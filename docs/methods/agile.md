This methodology involves continuous release cycles with each one including minor, incremental modifications from the previous release. The product is tested at each iteration.

The agile methodology is incremental and iterative, which makes them more effective than other methodologies. It ensures that minor problems in the project are resolved before they grow into bigger issues.
