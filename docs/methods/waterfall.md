# Waterfall

The waterfall model is the oldest, most straightforward, and most systematic methodology. It systematically arranges each phase so that the outcome of the previous phase determines the outcome of the subsequent phase. The design conceptually progresses like a waterfall from one phase to the next.

## Advantages of waterfall methodology
Here are some advantages of the waterfall methodology.

* It is straightforward to handle and adhere to.

* The waterfall methodology is most appropriate for small software development projects when requirements can be precisely pre-defined and activities are simple to organize and manage.

* The ability to track and evaluate progress is made possible by having an early, clearly defined end state.

* Early in the project, customers and developers reach an understanding of expected results making it easier for a large part of the process to progress after receiving the requirements without involving the customer.

## Limitations of waterfall methodology

Here are some challenges that come with waterfall methodology.

* The waterfall methodology is rigid. Once a phase is declared finished, there isn't much room for change because revisions can affect the price, the time it takes to deliver the program and its quality.

* Few customers or end users are involved, which can cause some customers to feel excluded.

* This method puts off testing until the end of the process, which could allow minor problems to grow into bigger ones before being discovered.

* Products take longer to deliver in this methodology compared to more iterative techniques, like agile.
