# What is SDLC?
Development teams employ the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a time- and money-efficient approach, to create high-quality software.

The SDLC develops and specifies a comprehensive plan with stages, or phases, each of which includes its procedure and outputs.

The SDLC's objectives are to reduce project risks and create excellent software that meets and exceeds all client requirements.

## Why is SDLC Important
Here is why SDLC is important for development teams.

* It helps with project estimating, planning, and scheduling.

* All team members involved in the development process have more insight into every stage of the life cycle, which facilitates better project tracking and control.

* The rate of development is accelerated with SDLC.

* It offers a uniform framework that specifies tasks and outputs.

* It strengthens relationships with clients and lowers project risks.
 
* It serves as a blueprint for the designers.

* It lowers production costs overall and project management costs.

* The entire software development process for your product can be made easier with the help of SDLC.
