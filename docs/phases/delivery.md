# Delivery and Maintenance
Once the tested product performs at its peak it is moved on to this phase. The client (s) receives the product all at once or in batches and they decide if the software product should undergo beta testing or not. If any error occurs, the product is sent back to the development team for correction.

## The development team should know the following at this phase:

* If the customer is satisfied with the onsite product

* If customers are facing any issues with the product

* Are the support team able to answer customers' questions

At this phase, the customer service staff uses client comments and responses to compile reports on what works well and what needs to be improved. These comments help the development team to create a better-upgraded version of the product.
