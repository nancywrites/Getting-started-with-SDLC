# Testing and Integration
After the code is written, the product goes through non-functional as well as functional testing, including unit, integration, system, and acceptability testing.

This phase ensures that the software is flawless and satisfies consumer needs.

## The development team should know the following at this phase:

* If the final check is properly done before a product release.

* If any bugs are discovered

* If the new features are compared to the previous ones.

It's important to note that at this phase if bugs or errors occur, they are sent back to the development stage, where programmers fix any flaws or errors. This phase will be repeated and iterative until no bugs or errors are found.
