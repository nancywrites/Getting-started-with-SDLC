# Analysis
At this phase, A Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document is developed after proper planning. This document contains all the product requirements required throughout the life cycle process, and it will be shared with the development team for review and consideration before the requirements specified in this document are either accepted or rejected.

## The development team should know the following at this phase:

* If the users need to be analyzed.

* If there are existing products with the same features on the market being analyzed.

* If resources, timeframes, and financial constraints are calculated.

* The technologies that can support the product.
