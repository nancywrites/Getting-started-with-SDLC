# Design
After the final Software Requirement Specification document has been approved, the project moves on to the following stage of the development cycle, the design phase.

The design specification document which describes the features of the product in detail is created during this phase. The document gives programmers an idea of what they would need to start creating the product.

## The development team should know the following at this phase:

* Why a specific feature is needed.

* The problems the feature will solve.

* What the user will accomplish with the product.

* How to implement the features.

* What the user interface should look like.

* The systems and hardware necessary to define the overall architecture of the system

* How the product should work.
