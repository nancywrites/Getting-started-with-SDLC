Development teams employ the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a time- and money-efficient approach, to create high-quality software. The SDLC develops and specifies a comprehensive plan with stages, or phases, each of which includes its procedure and outputs. The SDLC's objectives are to reduce project risks and create excellent software that meets and exceeds all client requirements. Why is SDLC Important Here is why SDLC is important for development teams. It helps with project estimating, planning, and scheduling. All team members involved in the development process have more insight into every stage of the life cycle, which facilitates better project tracking and control. The rate of development is accelerated with SDLC. It offers a uniform framework that specifies tasks and outputs. It strengthens relationships with clients and lowers project risks. It serves as a blueprint for the designers. It lowers production costs overall and project management costs. The entire software development process for your product can be made easier with the help of SDLC.","title":"What is SDLC?"},{"location":"firstpage/#what-is-sdlc","text":"Development teams employ the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), a time- and money-efficient approach, to create high-quality software.

The product is tested at each iteration. The agile methodology is incremental and iterative, which makes them more effective than other methodologies. It ensures that minor problems in the project are resolved before they grow into bigger issues. Advantages of Agile methodology Here are some advantages of the agile methodology. It is flexible. The development team can easily move from one phase to the next without being concerned that the prior phase isn't flawless or finished. The product in this methodology takes a shorter time to market compared to the waterfall methodology. This methodology gives the customer numerous opportunities to provide feedback on the product because it is very user-focused. Its iterative structure, which enables early and frequent testing and feedback gathering, ensures risks are minimized. Limitations of Agile methodology Here are some challenges that come with Agile.

It systematically arranges each phase so that the outcome of the previous phase determines the outcome of the subsequent phase. The design conceptually progresses like a waterfall from one phase to the next. Advantages of waterfall methodology Here are some advantages of the waterfall methodology. It is straightforward to handle and adhere to. The waterfall methodology is most appropriate for small software development projects when requirements can be precisely pre-defined and activities are simple to organize and manage. The ability to track and evaluate progress is made possible by having an early, clearly defined end state. Early in the project, customers and developers reach an understanding of expected results making it easier for a large part of the process to progress after receiving the requirements without involving the customer. Limitations of waterfall methodology Here are some challenges that come with waterfall methodology. The waterfall methodology is rigid. Once a phase is declared finished, there isn't much room for change because revisions can affect the price, the time it takes to deliver the program and its quality. Few customers or end users are involved, which can cause some customers to feel excluded. This method puts off testing until the end of the process, which could allow minor problems to grow into bigger ones before being discovered. Products take longer to deliver in this methodology compared to more iterative techniques, like agile.","title":"Waterfall"},{"location":"methods/waterfall/#waterfall","text":"The waterfall model is the oldest, most straightforward, and most systematic methodology.
